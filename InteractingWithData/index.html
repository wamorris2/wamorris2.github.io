        <h1>Part 1: Plotly Parallel Categories Graph</h1>
        <p>
            The visualization shows that about 30% of people who never vote, 40% of people who sporadically vote, and 50% of people who always vote go to college, showing a clear upwards trend in that regard.  The income bracket where people who rarely/never vote make up the largest percentage is the "less than $40k" bracket. They are also most likely to only have only a high school diploma or less. On the other hand, of the people who go to college, most end up in a higher income bracket.  This is shown in the visualization as thicker and thicker lines stemming from the college bracket as you move down (higher) in the income category.

        <h1>Part 2: Plotly Bubble Graph</h1>
        <p>
            The election in 2020 has a different shape than all the others. Its percentage of absentee voters was dramatically higher than any other year, with one county having 85% of voters being absentee voters.  The main reason this is the case is that the Covid-19 pandemic was in full swing at the time, and, combined with a presidential election, a lot of people wanted to vote but didn't want to come out of their homes to vote.

            I think it would be harder but still possible for a viewer to determine that the election in 2020 was different.  The main advantage of the animation frame is that it allows an extra dimension of data to be added without shrinking the amount of spaces the x and y dimensions take up.  This allows a viewer to more clearly see the changes in turnout and absentee voter rates because they take up the same space.  The year 2020 sticks out in part because the viewer can see all points in the graph suddenly spike upwards in the y direction for a brief moment.  If they were placed side-by-side, the difference between them would be noticeable but not as pronounced.
            <br>
            The elections in 2016 and 2020 had noticeably higher voter turnout compared to the other years.  They both hung around an average of 80% turnout (estimated by eye) whereas the other years had closer to 50-60% turnout.

        <p>
            Counties with higher voter turnout tend to be in Northern and Eastern Virginia while Southern and Western counties tend to turnout less. In addition, in regards to cities within counties, the cities tend to have a lower turnout than the counties they are in, possibly due to the presence of the suburbs.
